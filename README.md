# FastAPI-xml 

A bridge between [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and [xsdata](https://github.com/tefra/xsdata). Together,
fastapi handles xml data structures using dataclasses generated by xsdata. Whilst, fastapi handles the api calls, xsdata
covers xml serialisation and deserialization. In addition, openapi support works as well.
 
# Install

`pip install fastapi-xml` will do the trick.


# Example

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from fastapi_xml import NonJsonRoute, XmlBody, XmlAppResponse
from fastapi import FastAPI

@dataclass
class Hello:
    message: str = field(metadata={"name": "Message", "type": "Element"})

@dataclass
class World:
    message: str = field(metadata={"name": "Message", "type": "Element"})

app = FastAPI(default_response_class=XmlAppResponse)
app.router.route_class = NonJsonRoute

@app.post("/echo", response_model=World)
def echo(x: Hello = XmlBody()) -> World:
    return World(message=x.message + " For ever!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

# Limitations
This package depends on fastapi and xsdata. However, fastapi depends on
pydantic, which ships a [bug](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/issues/4353) that causes several side effects.
Among other, this bug is fixed within the major branch. Nevertheless, the bug still occurs in the current version
(1.9.2). Anyhow, this package supports both versions.

  - :warning: Do not use keyword `required` for a field's metatdata. This will crash the openapi schema generator. Remove 
    typehint `Optional` instead.

  - :warning: You cannot use the same type for the response_model and the body. This will crash the openapi schema
    generator. For example, this will not work:
    
      ```python
      @app.post("/echo", response_model=Echo)
      def echo(x: Echo = XmlBody()) -> Echo:
      ```
    
    Recently, this bug was fixed within pydantic's main branch. However, it still exists in 1.9.2.
